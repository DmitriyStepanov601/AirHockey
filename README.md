# AirHockey

This app is an interpretation of the game Air Hockey. The goal of the game is to score the puck in the opponent's goal. 
The player who starts the match is determined by throwing the puck or drawing lots. For each goal scored in the opponent's goal, one point is awarded. 
The winner is the first person to score seven points. A goal is scored when the puck falls into the goal, even if it is not recorded by an electronic 
scoring device. If the puck hangs in the goal at an angle — it is a goal.

The player can hit the puck when it is in his half of the field, and he must do this within 7 seconds. If he does not hit the puck during this time, 
the puck goes to the opponent.

Pressing the puck against the table with the bat is strictly prohibited (this is a very serious violation, as it can lead to damage to the playing surface), 
in this case the puck passes to the opponent. The player may not touch the puck with anything other than the bat. For this, the puck also passes to the 
opponent. If a player stops the puck with his hand or anything other than the bat, the violation is counted and a free kick is declared. Touching the puck 
on the opponent's side is also considered a violation. It is impossible to completely cross the center line with a crowd — the game stops and the move is 
transferred. If the puck leaves the table after a strong hit from someone else's cue ball, the move is passed to the defending player-despite the fact 
that the puck flew off his cue ball.


A very well-known tactic is "Stationary Officer" or simply "Elephant". The essence of this tactic is not to move away from the goal and cover the very 
middle, and if the puck flies to the edge of the goal, the bat can simply be moved a couple of centimeters. This tactic is only suitable for defense, 
it is not very convenient to attack.

Tactic:"The best defense is offense." The essence of it is to hammer the opponent into a corner with the sharpness of the blow. All strikes must occur 
very sharply and very strongly. But do not overdo it, this tactic can score not only the opponent, but also yourself. This tactic is more suitable only 
for the offensive, but it is very difficult to defend with this tactic.

The "Fun Corner" tactic. All strikes are carried out from the side, when you hit the puck with a cue ball, the angle should be directed to the 
opponent's goal, this tactic is easy for both offensive and defensive, but keep in mind that the opponent will not be able to level the puck the 
first time, so it will fly to you, respectively, at an angle.
